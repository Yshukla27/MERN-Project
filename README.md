# MERN-Project
A MERN stack based application i created as a task for my vocational training program.
The folder contains the contents of my views models and routes programs which i used to create and interlink my project.
The files like package.json, node_modules are not uploaded here to maintain some originality. 
This was my first attempt at creating a software, it took a lot of trial and error and help from LLMs like Chatgpt to help me debug the mess. But in the end it was worth it.
